The ThinkPad needs a directory called /backup (at the "/" root level) for this script to work.
The Digital Ocean server's IP address must not change, or this backup routine will break.  
The Digital Ocean server must have a directory /thinkpad (at the "/" root level) for the script to work.

-----------------------
Requirements that required manually configuration:

#1  The ThinkPad user account engi must be able to scp files to the Digital Ocean server passwordlessly.
#2  This user account should have passwordless elevation to sudo for the tar command.

You should add this stanza to the /etc/sudoers file:

engi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/tar

---------------------
FYI
The backups can hang (on the /sys directory) if someone is logged in.  Ideally the backups will handle when no one is logged in late at night.  We *could* consider excluding the /sys directory from the backups.

The Digital Ocean server is on UTC time.  The ThinkPad is in Eastern (NYC) time.  We may want to use NTP to enhance root cause analysis and troubleshooting.
-------------------------

To have the backup script run, the crontab job should have something like this (for running at 11:50 PM each night):

# m h  dom mon dow   command
50 23 * * * /bin/bash /home/engi/backup.sh
